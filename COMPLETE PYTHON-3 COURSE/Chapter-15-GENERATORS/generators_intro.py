# Generators
# generators are iterators

# iterable , iterator


l = [1,2,3,4]  # iterable

# for i in l:
#     print(i)

# i = iter(l)
# print(next(i))
# print(next(i))
# print(next(i))
# print(next(i))
# next(l) # 'list' object is not an iterator

# for num in map(lambda a :a**2, l):
#     print(num)

# l = [1,4,9,16]

# list store all items in memory
# generator store only one items at the time in the memory
#
# memory --- [.............................], list
# memory --- (9)
